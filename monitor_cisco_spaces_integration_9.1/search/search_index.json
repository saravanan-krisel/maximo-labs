Steps to Configure the Integration Log in to IBM MAS Monitor Access your MAS Monitor environment by logging in with your credentials in Maximo Application Suite. Navigate to Integrations Open the left-side navigation menu. Scroll to the Monitor applications list and select Setup \u2192 Integrations from the menu options. Add a New Integration On the Integrations screen, click the Add Integration button to start configuring a new integration. Select Cisco Spaces as the Integration Type In the integration configuration dialog, choose Cisco Spaces as the integration type. Provide Integration Details Enter a meaningful Integration Name . Paste the Activation Token you copied from the previous exercise. Click Finish to complete the integration setup. Warning Ensure the Activation Token is correct. Make sure the token has not expired. Verify the token has not been used previously for activation. Once a token is activated, an activation key is stored in the database, making that token unusable for any other integration. One token can only be used for a single configuration. Only a correct and valid token will be saved successfully; otherwise, the integration setup will fail with an error. Verify Integration Once the integration is added successfully, its details will appear on the Integrations list page. This confirms that the configuration has been saved.

The Activation Token allows MAS Monitor to fetch building and location data from Cisco Spaces, enabling location-aware monitoring and insights. Steps to add the Integration to MAS Monitor Log in to Cisco Spaces Open dnaspaces.io/login in your browser and sign in using your Cisco Spaces credentials. Search for the Application After logging in, navigate to the Home page. Use the search bar to find the application. For this exercise, we will use the app named Copy_Test App_TBI (Prod) . Search for the Application Ensure you search for the application that contains the list of buildings or locations relevant to your integration. The application should include the physical spaces / locations you intend to monitor with MAS Monitor. Open the Application Settings Once you locate the app tile for Copy_Test App_TBI (Prod) , click on the gear icon located on the tile to open the application\u2019s settings. Generate a New Activation Key In the new window that opens, click on the New Activation button to start the process of generating a new activation key. Select Locations In the New App Activation window, select the locations (buildings or areas) you want MAS Monitor to access. This selection determines which physical spaces will be integrated into MAS Monitor. After selecting the desired locations, click Next to proceed. Generate the Activation Token Review your selection. Then, click on the Generate Activation Key button. This action will create your Activation Token (JWT token), which you can use in MAS Monitor to complete the integration. Copy and Store the Activation Token Once the activation key is generated, Copy Token and keep it stored securely. You will need this token when configuring the Cisco Spaces integration within the MAS Monitor application.","title":"2.
